setup:
1. install sqlexplorer plugin in eclipse (need to install JBoss Tools plugin to do that)
2. Create hibernate user library with provided jars and add it to build path
3. New -> Hibernate -> Hibernate Configuration File (cfg.xml) -> Next -> Give a name for configuration file -> Get values from
connection -> New -> Select regarding option -> 
Add jdbc driver for the specific database in plus symbol window's jar list tab -> Add connection properties like database, url 
&& etc -> Test connection -> if ping succeeded next and 
file is there

(hibernate.cfg.xml : default name for hibernate configuration file, no need to tell hibernate about name of the configuration 
file if this name is used)

only one session factory per application

 <!-- Drop and re-create the database schema on startup -->
        <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property>
is handy when need to do many changes in schema (while developing)

<property name="hbm2ddl.auto">update</property> : there is a model change -> update

<property name="show_sql">true</property> : to print SQL queries in console

@Entity (name="TABLE_USER_DETAILS") is useful need to have different name for table from class or the other way round

@Column(name = "COLUMN_USER_NAME") is useful need to have different name for column from attribute or the other way round

It is allowed to have @Column annotation on top of getter method instead for having it on top of the attribute

@Entity(name = "TABLE_USER_DETAILS_BY_ENTITY") vs @Table(name = "TABLE_USER_DETAILS_BY_TABLE"): entity is shown as 
TABLE_USER_DETAILS_BY_ENTITY and
actual table name is set as TABLE_USER_DETAILS_BY_TABLE

@Basic is used to tell hibernate that specific attribute is persistable. By default for all attribute @Basic will be there

static or transient attribute will not be saved

attribute annotated with @Transient will not be saved

@Temporal(value = TemporalType.DATE) : to save only date part(@Temporal(value = TemporalType.TIMESTAMP) is the default)

@Lob
private String description; : Large object - CLob : character large object, BLob : Byte large object (Hibernate chooses which 
type needs to be selected based on the
type of the attribute (String - CLob, byte - BLob)

Natural key : unique column is used as primary key, which has a business significant
Surrogate key : no business significant. dedicated to uniquely identify a record

If a key is a surrogate key, hibernate is able to handle that. @GeneratedValue is used for that. (Insight: hibernate is 
maintaining a sequence and use that to
generate value)
strategy=GenerationType.AUTO : let hibernate to decide the strategy to generate primary key

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

one attribute -> multiple column (Eg: An attribute is an object or an attribute is a collection)

Entity vs Value objects: Entity : needs to be saved in a separate table (UserDetails)
Value objects: not have meaning itself. depend on another object (Address)

value objects are saved along with entity with separate columns for them : value object needs to be marked as @Embeddable in the 
class name, @Embedded in the 
attribute name in another class.

Having multiple value object with same type:
Exception in thread "main" org.hibernate.MappingException: Repeated column in mapping for entity: org.jeya.dto.UserDetails 
column: COLUMN_CITY 
(should be mapped with insert="false" update="false")

Solution: override column name for other attributes
@AttributeOverride is used. Multiple @AttributeOverride are kept inside @AttributeOverrides

Embedded object as a primary key : annotate that attribute with @EmbeddedId

**************************************************************************************************

Collection of object as attribute:

separate table of collection and associated with user id

@ElementCollection is annotated above the attribute with collection type

@JoinTable(name="USER_ADDRESS",
			joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="USER_ID")) to have different name for joint table and column to join

@CollectionId is used to have primary key for joint table for collection : hibernate specific annotation: unavailable in JPA

Eager initialization vs Lazy initialization:
Eager initialization - When Session.get() all the addresses will be fetched for user details.
Lazy initialization - When userDetails.getListOfAddresses is invoked only addresses will be loaded. (default behavior)

when getter is invoked data is load. It is done by a proxy class. subclass of user details is created as proxy and second level 
of database operation is done
in proxy class when getter is invoked.
********************************************************************************************************

One to one mapping:
one entity inside another entity:
(Difference between value objects (simple Address) and UserDetails Vs Vehicle and UserDetails: Address has no significant 
without UserDetails, Vehicle is independent. Separate entity:
see <mapping class="org.jeya.dto.Vehicle" /> is not available for Address and address is not saved separately)

When there is no @OneToOne annotation in vehicle attribute:
Exception in thread "main" org.hibernate.MappingException: Could not determine type for: org.jeya.dto.Vehicle, at table: 
TABLE_USER_DETAILS5_BY_TABLE, for columns:
[org.hibernate.mapping.Column(vehicle)]

It is looking for a connection between both entities.
@OneToOne will add extra column in UserDetails table (vehicle_vehicleid)

*********************************************************************************************************

One to many mapping:
UserDetails with collection of vehicle. Create separate table to have  the relationship between vehicle and user details
@OneToMany annotation is used
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
object on the many side of the relationship has the reference to the other object.
One to many: having column for vehicle in UserDetails (multiple rows), having column for user in Vehicle is possible.
to do that we need to have bidirectional relationship (oneToMany and manyToOne) in related places and need to set data both way
(setUserDetails and setVehicle)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
***********************************************************************************************************
Many to one mapping:
Vehicle can have user details, Many vehicle will have one user

When there is no @ManyToOne annotation in user details attribute:
Exception in thread "main" org.hibernate.MappingException: Could not determine type for: org.jeya.dto.UserDetails7, at table: 
Vehicle2, for columns: 
[org.hibernate.mapping.Column(userDetails)]

userdetails_userid column is added to vehicle table
***********************************************************************************************************
Many to many mapping:
There should be separate table for mapping
Rented vehicle for users
@ManyToMany should be in both places with mappedBy in one place. if there is no mappedBy, two tables will be
created with redundant data
***********************************************************************************************************
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Many to one mapping for Vehicle to user details. If there is no user for a vehicle. Hibernate throws an exception. need to 
suppress this exception.
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name="USERID")
@NotFound(action=NotFoundAction.IGNORE) // if user details is not found just ignore it
private UserDetails8 userDetails;

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Hibernate maintains semantic in order to maintain a collection

Eg: Bag semantic, Bag semantic with ID, List semantic(List or ArrayList)
Set semantic (Set), Map semantic (Map)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A user has 10 vehicles. Save them and delete them. need to do the create, update, delete.

Error during managed flush [org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the 
transient instance before flushing: org.jeya.dto.Vehicle5]:
when try to save without cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST

session.save(userDetails10); with cascade : same exception as above

persist method should be used with cascade

cascade=CascadeType.ALL : to perform operation in cascade for all detach, persist, merge, refresh and move operation

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Inheritance:

problem in persisting only subclasses as entity: 

1. (can't use polymorphism : Vehicle v - dynamically change vehicle)
2. auto data fill is not in both table

Hibernate implements a strategy by default known as Single table strategy: dtype, vehicleid, vehiclename, steeringhandle, 
steeringwheel (saved all three of vehicle, two wheeler 
and three wheeler are saved in single table.

dtype : to identify class of object - discriminator

override the discriminator value : @DiscriminatorValue("BIKE")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table per class strategy:

table per class and attributes from parent class are inherited and they are separate columns in subclass table

advantage:
normalized form

Disadvantage:
redundant columns in each subclasses.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joined strategy:

Attributes related with super class will be saved in super class table and others will be saved in sub class table. Query to get 
entire subclass record:
select * from Vehicle8 join FourWheeler3 on Vehicle8.vehicleid = FourWheeler3.vehicleid

advantage:
more normalized form than table per class strategy

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not saved object: Transient
after a session.save(user); changes will be taken as update statement before commit the transaction.
Once an object is provided to Hibernate to save, it will track the changes for that object until the transaction is committed.

Before session.save: Transient object
after session.save : become persistent object
after session.close : become detached object

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
create: transient -> persistent -> detached
read: persistent(by default) -> detached
delete : transient <- persistent -> detached
update : detached object + (user input) -> persistent (even though no changes in data, it will invoke update query: hibernate 
doesn't know whether there is a change or not since update is from
another session: if update call is from same session with no changes, will not invoked the call)
(we can configure hibernate using @org.hibernate.annotations.Entity(selectBeforeUpdate=true) so that it can invoke update query, 
only if there are changes available to be saved)

===================================================================================================================

HQL : Hibernate Query Language

-instead for table names, class names are used
-instead for column names, property names are used

Named queries : to identify query easy and modify
@NamedQuery(name = "UserDetails12.byId", query = "from UserDetails12 where userId = ?") in Entity and get as namedQuery from 
session (HQL)

Having SQL as named query: @NamedNativeQuery
===================================================================================================================

Hibernate data retrival:

1. By session.get
2. By query (HQL)
3. By criteria API

====================================================================================================================

Criteria is like where clause

Example : not considered null value and primary key value
when it is needed to be excluded a property in Example, it can be done by
	Example example2 = Example.create(exampleUser).excludeProperty("userName");
	
====================================================================================================================

Cache in hibernate:

By default first level cache:

1. select again
2. update without changes

first level of caching in session: not available across session
second level of caching : needs to be configured
-across sessions
-across applications
-across clusters

Second level cache:

caching strategies:

1. CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_ONLY : application do only reading operation, not write
Pull the data, hibernate doesn't worry about data is dirty or clean since application is able to read only
2. CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_WRITE : application do both of read and write operation
Hibernate keeps track of dirty *** better option
3. NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE : some cases, not checked for dirty data
4. TRANSACTIONAL : make sure that cache is on transactional basis
====================================================================================================================

Why separate configuration for query cache: result by session.get is saved in different place than result by query
(Second level caching differs from query cache)
